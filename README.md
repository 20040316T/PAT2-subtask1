# PAT2-subtask1Morse code is a method of encoding text using sequences of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). Developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, it was designed for telegraphy to transmit messages over long distances via electrical pulses or light/sound signals.
Each letter and number has a unique code:
•	A = ·−
•	B = −···
•	C = −·−·
•	1 = ·−−−−
•	9 = −−−−·
It became a vital tool in early radio communication, aviation, and military messaging. Though largely replaced by modern technologies, Morse code is still used today in niche areas like amateur radio and emergency signaling—such as the universally recognized distress signal SOS (···−−−···).

Morse code was created in the early 19th century to solve a major communication problem of the time: how to send messages quickly over long distances.
Historical Context:
In the 1830s, long-distance communication was extremely slow, relying on physical transport methods like horseback messengers or mail coaches. Messages could take days or even weeks to arrive. The need for faster communication became especially urgent with the rapid expansion of commerce, railroads, and government operations across growing nations like the United States.
Samuel Morse, a painter and inventor, began working on an electric telegraph system after experiencing personal tragedy due to delayed news of his wife's death. Partnering with Alfred Vail, Morse developed a working telegraph and a new way to encode messages—what we now call Morse code.
The system used electrical pulses to represent letters and numbers, allowing messages to be sent instantly over wires. The first successful demonstration of Morse code took place in 1844 with the famous message: "What hath God wrought", sent from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore.
Morse code revolutionized communication, playing a major role in:
•	Expanding railroads (for train scheduling and safety)
•	Enabling faster military coordination
•	Improving news dissemination
•	Supporting maritime communication
It laid the groundwork for modern digital communication systems.
