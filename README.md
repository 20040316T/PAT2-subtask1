# PAT2-subtask1Morse code is a method of encoding text using sequences of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). Developed in the 1830s and 1840s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, it was designed for telegraphy to transmit messages over long distances via electrical pulses or light/sound signals.
Each letter and number has a unique code:
•	A = ·−
•	B = −···
•	C = −·−·
•	1 = ·−−−−
•	9 = −−−−·
It became a vital tool in early radio communication, aviation, and military messaging. Though largely replaced by modern technologies, Morse code is still used today in niche areas like amateur radio and emergency signaling—such as the universally recognized distress signal SOS (···−−−···).
